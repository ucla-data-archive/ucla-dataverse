Content
-------

* Scope: We allow all research artifacts created from research projects at UCLA  to be made publicly available, widely discoverable, linkable, and ultimately, reusable.
* Stage of research data:  Data from any stage of the research lifecycle is accepted
* Eligibility: You are a faculty member, staff member, or student and have a UCLA Logon ID
* Rights: By uploading content, no change of ownership is implied and no property rights are transferred to the UCLA Library. All uploaded content remains the property of the parties prior to submission
* Data file formats: All formats are allowed - even preservation unfriendly. Dataverse will convert certain tabular data formats (Stata, XLS, R, SPSS) into plane-text tab delimited files.
* Volume and size limitations: Total files size limit per record is 50GB. Higher quotas can be requested and granted on a case-by-case basis.
* Data quality: All information is provided **as-is**, and the user shall hold UCLA and information providers supplying data to UCLA free and harmless in connection with the use of such information. UCLA Dataverse accepts data deposited **as-is**.  As file formats become obsolete, UCLA Dataverse will not migrate data to newer formats, although deposits which the content owner has migrated will be accepted.  In the case of unusual or proprietary file formats, Dataverse cannot guarantee their readability in future years.
* Metadata types and sources: All metadata is stored internally in JSON-format according to a defined JSON schema. Metadata is exported in several standard formats such as MARCXML, Dublin Core, and DataCite Metadata Schema (according to the OpenAIRE Guidelines).
* Licenses: Users must specify a license for all publicly available files. Licenses for closed access files may be specified in the description field.

* In some specific cases, data may be withdrawn from UCLA Dataverse.  These include demonstrated copyright violation, violations of legal requirements, verified plagiarism, falsified research, and for reasons of National Security.  Withdrawn items are not deleted, but will be removed from public view. As appropriate, UCLA Dataverse will redirect DOI's for withdrawn items to "tombstone" sites which will contain details of the reason for the withdrawal, and provide links to replacement content if it is available.
