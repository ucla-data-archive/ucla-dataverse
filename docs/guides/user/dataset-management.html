<p>A dataset contains three levels of metadata:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Citation Metadata</strong>: any metadata that would be needed for generating a data citation and other general metadata that could be applied to any dataset;</li>
<li><strong>Domain Specific Metadata</strong>: with specific support currently for Social Science, Life Science, Geospatial, and Astronomy datasets; and</li>
<li><strong>File-level Metadata</strong>: varies depending on the type of data file - see <em>File Handling and Uploading</em> section below for more details).</li>
</ol>
<p>For more details about what Citation and Domain Specific Metadata is supported please see our <a class="reference internal" href="appendix.html#user-appendix"><span class="std std-ref">Appendix</span></a>.</p>
<p>Note that once a dataset has been published its metadata may be exported. A button on the dataset pageâs metadata tab will allow a user to export the metadata of the most recently published version of the dataset. Currently supported export formats are DDI, Dublin Core and JSON.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">File Upload</a><a class="headerlink" href="#file-upload" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>The Dataverse software offers multiple methods of uploading files to a dataset. These upload methods are configurable by the administrator of a Dataverse installation, so you might not see some of these options on the Dataverse site youâre using.</p>
<p>If there are multiple upload options available, then you must choose which one to use for your dataset. A dataset may only use one upload method. Once you upload a file using one of the available upload methods, that method is locked in for that dataset. If you need to switch upload methods for a dataset that already contains files, then please contact Support by clicking on the Support link at the top of the application.</p>
<p>You can upload files to a dataset while first creating that dataset. You can also upload files after creating a dataset by clicking the âEditâ button at the top of the dataset page and from the dropdown list selecting âFiles (Upload)â or clicking the âUpload Filesâ button above the files table in the Files tab. From either option you will be brought to the Upload Files page for that dataset.</p>
<p>Certain file types in Dataverse are supported by additional functionality, which can include downloading in different formats, subsets, file-level metadata preservation, file-level data citation; and exploration through data visualization and analysis. See the File Handling section of this page for more information.</p>
<div class="section" id="http-upload">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">HTTP Upload</a><a class="headerlink" href="#http-upload" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>HTTP Upload is a common browser-based file upload tool you may be familiar with from other web applications. You can upload files via HTTP by selecting them from your browser or dragging and dropping them into the upload widget.</p>
<p>Once you have uploaded files, you will be able to edit file metadata, restrict access to files <a class="footnote-reference" href="#f1" id="id1">[1]</a> , and/or add tags. Click âSave Changesâ to complete the upload. If you uploaded a file by mistake, you can delete it before saving by clicking the checkbox to select the file, and then clicking the âDeleteâ button above the Files Table.</p>
<p>File upload limit size varies based on Dataverse installation. The file upload size limit can be found in the text above the HTTP upload widget. If you need to upload a very large file or a very large <em>number</em> of files, consider using rsync + SSH upload if your installation of Dataverse offers it.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">Dropbox Upload</a><a class="headerlink" href="#dropbox-upload" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>Some Dataverse installations support the ability to upload files directly from Dropbox. To do so, click the âUpload from Dropboxâ button, log in to Dropbox in the pop-up window, and select the files youâd like to transfer over.</p>

<p>rsync is typically used for synchronizing files and directories between two different systems, using SSH to connect rather than HTTP. Some Dataverse installations allow uploads using rsync, to facilitate large file transfers in a reliable and secure manner.</p>
<div class="section" id="file-upload-script">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">File Upload Script</a><a class="headerlink" href="#file-upload-script" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h4>
<p>An rsync-enabled Dataverse installation has a file upload process that differs from the traditional browser-based upload process you may be used to. In order to transfer your data to Dataverseâs storage, you will need to complete the following steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Create your dataset. In rsync-enabled Dataverse installations, you cannot upload files until the dataset creation process is complete. After you hit âSave Datasetâ on the Dataset Creation page, you will be taken to the page for your dataset.</li>
<li>On the dataset page, click the â+ Upload Filesâ button. This will open a box with instructions and a link to the file upload script.</li>
<li>Make sure your files are ready for upload. You will need to have one directory that you can point the upload script to. All files in this directory and in any subdirectories will be uploaded. The directory structure will be preserved, and will be reproduced when your dataset is downloaded from Dataverse. Note that your data will be uploaded in the form of a data package, and each dataset can only host one such package. Be sure that all files you want to include are present before you upload.</li>
<li>Download the rsync file upload script by clicking the âDownload Scriptâ button in the Upload Files instruction box. There are no requirements for where you save the script; put it somewhere you can find it. Downloading the upload script will put a temporary lock on your dataset to prepare it for upload. While your dataset is locked, you will not be able to delete or publish your dataset, or edit its metadata. Once you upload your files and Dataverse processes them, your dataset will be automatically unlocked and these disabled functions will be enabled again. If you have downloaded the script and locked your dataset, but you have then changed your mind and decided <em>not</em> to upload files, please contact Support about unlocking your dataset.</li>
<li>To begin the upload process, you will need to run the script you downloaded. For this, you will have to go outside your browser and open a terminal (AKA command line) window on your computer. Use the terminal to navigate to the directory where you saved the upload script, and run the command that the Upload Files instruction box provides. This will begin the upload script. Please note that this upload script will expire 7 days after you downloaded it. If it expires and you still need to use it, simply download the script from Dataverse again.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Unlike other operating systems, Windows does not come with rsync supported by default. We have not optimized this feature for Windows users, but you may be able to get it working if you install the right Unix utilities. (If you have found a way to get this feature working for you on Windows, you can contribute it to our project. Please reference our <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">Contributing to Dataverse</a> document in the root of the source tree.)</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="6">
<li>Follow the instructions provided by the upload script running in your terminal. It will direct you to enter the full path of the directory where your dataset files are located, and then it will start the upload process. Once youâve initiated the upload, if you need to cancel it then you can do so by canceling the script running in your terminal window. If your upload gets interrupted, you can resume it from the same point later.</li>
<li>Once the upload script completes its job, Dataverse will begin processing your data upload and running a checksum validation. This may take some time depending on the file size of your upload. During processing, you will see a blue bar at the bottom of the dataset page that reads âUpload in progressâ¦â</li>
<li>Once processing is complete, you will be notified. At this point you can publish your dataset and your data will be available for download on the dataset page.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A dataset can only hold one data package. If you need to replace the data package in your dataset, contact Support.</p>

<p>Files in certain formats - Stata, SPSS, R, Excel(xlsx) and CSV - may be ingested as tabular data (see âTabular Data Ingestâ section of the User Guide for details). Tabular data files can be further explored and manipulated with <a class="reference external" href="../user/data-exploration/tworavens.html">TwoRavens</a> - a statistical data exploration application integrated with Dataverse, as well as other <span class="xref std std-doc">/installation/external-tools</span> if they have been enabled in the installation of Dataverse you are using. TwoRavens allows the user to run statistical models, view summary statistics, download subsets of variable vectors and more. To start, click on the âExploreâ button, found next to each relevant tabular file (the application will be opened in a new window). To download subsets of variables click on the âDownloadâ button found next to a relevant tabular file and select âData Subsetâ in the dropdown menu. You will then be able to create your subset using the interface opened in a new window (this functionality is also provided by the <a class="reference external" href="../user/data-exploration/tworavens.html">TwoRavens</a> project). See the <a class="reference external" href="../user/data-exploration/tworavens.html">TwoRavens documentation section</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Additional download options available for tabular data (found in the same drop-down menu under the âDownloadâ button):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>As tab-delimited data (with the variable names in the first row);</li>
<li>The original file uploaded by the user;</li>
<li>Saved as R data (if the original file was not in R format);</li>
<li>Variable Metadata (as a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ddialliance.org/Specification/DDI-Codebook/">DDI Codebook</a> XML file);</li>

<p>Geospatial <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile">shapefiles</a> can be further explored and manipulated through our integration with <a class="reference external" href="../user/data-exploration/worldmap.html">WorldMap</a>, a geospatial data visualization and analysis tool developed by the <a class="reference external" href="http://gis.harvard.edu/">Center for Geographic Analysis</a> at Harvard University. A shapefile is a set of files, often uploaded/transferred in .zip format.  This set may contain up to 15 files.  A minimum of 3 specific files (.shp, .shx, .dbf) are needed to be a valid shapefile and a 4th file (.prj) is required for WorldMapâor any type of meaningful visualization.</p>
<p>For ingest into Dataverse and connecting to WorldMap, these 4 files are the minimum required:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>.shp - shape format; the feature geometry itself</li>
<li>.shx - shape index format; a positional index of the feature geometry to allow seeking forwards and backwards quickly</li>
<li>.dbf - attribute format; columnar attributes for each shape, in dBase IV format</li>
<li>.prj - projection format; the coordinate system and projection information, a plain text file describing the projection using well-known text format</li>
</ul>
<p>For a zipped shapefile, we require 4 files with these extensions. Other files may be included within the zipped shapefile, but they are not required:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>.shp</li>
<li>.shx</li>
<li>.prj</li>
<li>.dbf</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if these files were included within a .zip, the âMap Dataâ button would appear:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>subway_line.shp</li>
<li>subway_line.shx</li>
<li>subway_line.prj</li>
<li>subway_line.dbf</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you publish your dataset with your shape files, you will be able to use the âMap Dataâ button using <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/IQSS/geoconnect">GeoConnect</a> to visualize and manipulate these files for users to Explore this geospatial data using the <a class="reference external" href="http://worldmap.harvard.edu/">WorldMap</a> interface. Please note: In order to map your data file, a copy will be sent to Harvardâs <a class="reference external" href="http://worldmap.harvard.edu/">WorldMap</a> platform. You have the ability to delete any maps, and associated data, from the Harvard WorldMap platform, at any time.</p>

<p>In cases where you would like to revise an existing file rather than add a new one, you can do so using our Replace File feature. This will allow you to track the history of this file across versions of your dataset, both before and after replacing it. This could be useful for updating your data or fixing mistakes in your data. Because replacing a file creates an explicit link between the previous dataset version and the current version, the file replace feature is not available for unpublished dataset drafts. Also note that replacing a file will not automatically carry over that fileâs metadata, but once the file is replaced then its original metadata can still be found by referencing the previous version of the file under the âVersionsâ tab of the file page.</p>
<p>To replace a file, go to the file page for that file, click on the âEditâ button, and from the dropdown list select âReplaceâ. This will bring you to the Replace File page, where you can see the metadata for the most recently published version of the file and you can upload your replacement file. Once you have uploaded the replacement file, you can edit its name, description, and tags. When youâre finished, click the âSave Changesâ button.</p>
<p>After successfully replacing a file, a new dataset draft version will be created. A summary of your actions will be recorded in the âVersionsâ tab on on both the dataset page and file page. The Versions tab allows you to access all previous versions of the file across all previous versions of your dataset, including the old version of the file before you replaced it.</p>

<p>Dataset terms can be viewed and edited from the Terms tab of the dataset page, or under the Edit dropdown button of a Dataset. There, you can set up how users can use your data once they have downloaded it (CC0 waiver or custom Terms of Use), how they can access your data if you have files that are restricted (terms of access), and enable a Guestbook for your dataset so that you can track who is using your data and for what purposes. These are explained in further detail below:</p>
<div class="section" id="cc0-public-domain-dedication">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id24">CC0 Public Domain Dedication</a><a class="headerlink" href="#cc0-public-domain-dedication" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>By default, all new datasets created through Dataverseâs web UI are given a <a class="reference external" href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">Creative Commons CC0 Public Domain Dedication</a>.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> organization defines a number of <a class="reference external" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/">licenses</a> that allow copyright holders to release their intellectual property more openly, with fewer legal restrictions than standard copyright enforces. Each Creative Commons license typically specifies simple terms for how the IP must be used, reused, shared, and attributed. In addition to these licenses, Creative Commons also provides public domain tools that make it easy to dedicate IP to the public domain.</p>
<p>In the context of Dataverse, their <a class="reference external" href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0">CC0 Public Domain Dedication</a> allows you to unambiguously waive all copyright control over your data in all jurisdictions worldwide. Data released with CC0 can be freely copied, modified, and distributed (even for commercial purposes) without violating copyright. In most parts of the world, factual data is exempt from copyright anyway, but applying CC0 removes all ambiguity and makes the legal copyright status of the data as clear as possible. Dataverse applies CC0 to datasets by default because it facilitates reuse, extensibility, and long-term preservation of research data by assuring that the data can be safely handled by anyone without fear of potential copyright pitfalls.</p>
<p>Though CC0 waives a dataset ownerâs legal copyright controls over the data, it does not exempt Dataverse users from following ethical and professional norms in scholarly communications. The <a class="reference external" href="https://dataverse.org/best-practices/dataverse-community-norms">Dataverse Community Norms</a> * as well as scientific best practices assert that proper credit should be given via citation. Regardless of whether CC0 has been applied or not, Dataverse users are expected to cite the data they use, giving credit to the dataâs authors. This expectation applies to both the Dataverse Community and the entire wider scholarly community.</p>
<p>Additionally, users are still expected to respect access restrictions and other terms applied to CC0 files in Dataverse. Additional restrictions, conditions, and terms can still be compatible with CC0, as CC0 only operates in the realm of copyright, which is rather limited when it comes to data.</p>
<p>If a data owner feels that CC0 is not suitable for their data, they are able to enter custom Terms of Use, as detailed in the following section.</p>
<p>* <strong>Legal Disclaimer:</strong> these <a class="reference external" href="https://dataverse.org/best-practices/dataverse-community-norms">Community Norms</a> are not a substitute for the CC0 waiver or custom terms and licenses applicable to each dataset. The Community Norms are not a binding contractual agreement, and that downloading datasets from Dataverse does not create a legal obligation to follow these policies.</p>

To do so, select âNo, do not apply CC0 - âPublic Domain Dedicationâ, and a Terms of Use text box will show up allowing you to enter your own custom terms of use for your dataset.

<span id="provenance"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id31">Data Provenance</a><a class="headerlink" href="#data-provenance" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>Data Provenance is a record of where your data came from and how it reached its current form. It describes the origin of a data file, any transformations that have been made to that file, and any persons or organizations associated with that file. A data fileâs provenance can aid in reproducibility and compliance with legal regulations. Dataverse can help you keep track of your dataâs provenance. Currently, Dataverse only makes provenance information available to those who have edit permissions on your dataset, but in the near future we plan to expand this feature to make provenance information available to the public. You can track our progress in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/4346">this issue</a> on the Dataverse GitHub repository.</p>
<p>Dataverse accepts provenance information in two forms: a <em>Provenance File</em> or a free-text <em>Provenance Description</em>. You can attach this provenance information to your data files in Dataverse as part of the file upload process, by clicking Edit -&gt; Provenance:</p>
<p><img alt="file-upload-prov-button" class="img-responsive" src="../_images/prov0.png" /></p>
<p>This will open a window where you can add your Provenance File and/or Provenance Description:</p>
<p><img alt="file-upload-prov-window" class="img-responsive" src="../_images/prov1.png" /></p>
<p>A <strong>Provenance File</strong> is the preferred way of submitting provenance information to Dataverse because it provides a detailed and trustworthy record. Provenance files are typically generated during the process of data analysis, using provenance capture tools like provR, RDataTracker, NoWorkFlow, recordr, or CamFlow.</p>
<p>Once you upload a provenance file, Dataverse will need some additional information in order to accurately connect it to your data file. Once provenance file upload finishes, an input box labeled âConnect entityâ will appear under the file. Provenance files contain a list of âentitiesâ, which include your data file as well as any objects associated with it (e.g. a chart, a spellchecker, etc.). You will need to tell Dataverse which entity within the provenance file represents your data file. You may type the name of the entity into the box, or click the arrow next to the box and select the entity from a list of all entities in the provenance file.</p>
<p>For more information on entities and the contents of provenance files, see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-primer/#intuitive-overview-of-prov">the W3C PROV Model Primer</a>.</p>
<p>Once youâve uploaded your Provenance File and connected the proper entity, you can hit the Preview button to view the raw JSON of the Provenance File. This can help you confirm that youâve uploaded the right file. Be sure to double-check it, because the Provenance File will made <em>permanent</em> once itâs finalized. At that point you will not be able to <em>replace</em>, <em>remove</em>, or otherwise <em>edit</em> the Provenance File. This ensures that the Provenance File maintains a stable, immutable record of the data fileâs history. This finalization of the Provenance File happens at different points depending on the status of your data file. If this is a brand new data file that has never been published before, then its associated Provenance File will be made permanent once you publish the dataset. If this data file <em>has</em> been published in a previous version of your dataset, then its associated Provenance File will be made permanent as soon as you upload the Provenance File and click âSave Changesâ on the warning popup.</p>
<p>A <strong>Provenance Description</strong> allows you to add more provenance information in addition to or in place of a provenance file. This is a free-text field that allows you to enter any information you feel might be relevant to those interested in learning about the provenance of your data. This might be a good place to describe provenance factors like what operating system you used when working with the data file, what functions or libraries you used, how data was merged into the file, what version of the file you used, etc. The Provenance Description is not as useful or trustworthy as a provenance file, but it can still provide value. Unlike the Provenance File, the Provenance Description is never made permanent: you can always edit, remove, or replace it at any time.</p>
<p>You can return to attach provenance to your data file later on by clicking the âAdd + Edit Metadataâ button on the file page, and then clicking the âEdit -&gt; Provenanceâ button.</p>

<p>Thumbnail images can be assigned to a dataset manually or automatically. The thumbnail for a dataset appears on the search result card for that dataset and on the dataset page itself. If a dataset contains one or more data files that Dataverse recognizes as an image, then one of those images is automatically selected as the dataset thumbnail.</p>
<p>If you would like to manually select your datasetâs thumbnail, you can do so by clicking the âEditâ button on your dataset, and selecting âThumbnails + Widgetsâ from the dropdown menu.</p>
<p>On this page, under the Thumbnail tab you will see three possible actions.</p>
<p><strong>Select Available File:</strong> Click the âSelect Thumbnailâ button to choose an image from your dataset to use as the dataset thumbnail.</p>
<p><strong>Upload New File:</strong> Upload an image file from your computer to use as the dataset thumbnail. While by default your thumbnail image is drawn from a file in your dataset, this will allow you to upload a separate image file to use as your dataset thumbnail. This uploaded image file will only be used as the dataset thumbnail; it will not be stored as a data file in your dataset.</p>
<p><strong>Remove Thumbnail:</strong> If you click the âRemoveâ button under the thumbnail image, you will remove the datasetâs current thumbnail. The Dataset will then revert to displaying a basic default icon as the dataset thumbnail.</p>
<p>When youâre finished on this page, be sure to click âSave Changesâ to save what youâve done.</p>

<p>When you publish a dataset (available to an Admin, Curator, or any custom role which has this level of permission assigned), you make it available to the public so that other users can browse or search for it. Once your dataset is ready to go public, go to your dataset page and click on the âPublishâ button on the right hand side of the page. A pop-up will appear to confirm that you are ready to actually Publish since once a dataset is made public it can no longer be unpublished.</p>
<p>Whenever you edit your dataset, you are able to publish a new version of the dataset. The publish dataset button will reappear whenever you edit the metadata of the dataset or add a file.</p>
<p>Note: Prior to publishing your dataset the Data Citation will indicate that this is a draft but the âDRAFT VERSIONâ text
will be removed as soon as you Publish.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id39">Submit for Review</a><a class="headerlink" href="#submit-for-review" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>If you have a Contributor role (can edit metadata, upload files, and edit files, edit Terms, Guestbook, and Submit datasets for review) in a Dataverse you can submit your dataset for review when you have finished uploading your files and filling in all of the relevant metadata fields. To Submit for Review, go to your dataset and click on the âSubmit for Reviewâ button, which is located next to the âEditâ button on the upper-right. Once Submitted for Review: the Admin or Curator for this Dataverse will be notified to review this dataset before they decide to either âPublishâ the dataset or âReturn to Authorâ. If the dataset is published the contributor will be notified that it is now published. If the dataset is returned to the author, the contributor of this dataset will be notified that they need to make modifications before it can be submitted for review again.</p>

<p>Creating a Private URL for your dataset allows you to share your dataset (for viewing and downloading of files) before it is published to a wide group of individuals who may not have a user account on Dataverse. Anyone you send the Private URL to will not have to log into Dataverse to view the dataset.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Go to your unpublished dataset</li>
<li>Select the âEditâ button</li>
<li>Select âPrivate URLâ in the dropdown menu</li>
<li>In the pop-up select âCreate Private URLâ</li>
<li>Copy the Private URL which has been created for this dataset and it can now be shared with anyone you wish to have access to view or download files in your unpublished dataset.</li>
</ol>
<p>To disable a Private URL and to revoke access, follow the same steps as above until step #3 when you return to the popup, click the âDisable Private URLâ button.</p>

<p>Versioning is important for long-term research data management where metadata and/or files are updated over time. It is used to track any metadata or file changes (e.g., by uploading a new file, changing file metadata, adding or editing metadata) once you have published your dataset.</p>
<p><img alt="image3" class="img-responsive" src="../_images/data_publishing_version_workflow.png" /></p>
<p>Once you edit your published dataset a new draft version of this dataset will be created. To publish this new version of your dataset, select the âPublish Datasetâ button on the top right side of the page. If you were at version 1 of your dataset, depending on the types of changes you had made, you would be asked to publish your draft as either version 1.1 or version 2.0.</p>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> If you add a file, your dataset will automatically be bumped up to a major version (e.g., if you were at 1.0 you will go to 2.0).</p>
<p>On the Versions tab of a dataset page, there is a versions table that displays the version history of the dataset. You can use the version number links in this table to navigate between the different versions of the dataset, including the unpublished draft version, if you have permission to access it.</p>
<p>There is also a Versions tab on the file page. The versions table for a file displays the same information as the dataset, but the summaries are filtered down to only show the actions related to that file. If a new dataset version were created without any changes to an individual file, that fileâs version summary for that dataset version would read âNo changes associated with this versionâ.</p>
<div class="section" id="version-details">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id42">Version Details</a><a class="headerlink" href="#version-details" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>To view exactly what has changed, starting from the originally published version to any subsequent published versions: click the Versions tab on the dataset page to see all versions and changes made for that particular dataset.</p>
<p>Once you have more than one version (this can simply be version 1 and a draft), you can click the âView Detailsâ link next to each summary to learn more about the metadata fields and files that were either added or edited. You can also click the checkboxes to select any two dataset versions, then click the âView Differencesâ button to open the Version Differences Details popup and compare the differences between them.</p>

<span id="cloud-storage"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id43">Cloud Storage + Computing</a><a class="headerlink" href="#cloud-storage-computing" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>Dataverse installations can be configured to facilitate cloud-based storage and/or computing (this feature is considered experimental at this time, and some of the kinks are still being worked out). While the default configuration for Dataverse uses a local file system for storing data, a cloud-enabled Dataverse installation can use a Swift object storage database for its data. This allows users to perform computations on data using an integrated cloud computing environment.</p>
<div class="section" id="cloud-computing">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id44">Cloud Computing</a><a class="headerlink" href="#cloud-computing" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>The âComputeâ button on dataset and file pages will allow you to compute on a single dataset, multiple datasets, or a single file. You can use it to build a compute batch and go directly to the cloud computing environment that is integrated with Dataverse.</p>
</div>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id45">Cloud Storage Access</a><a class="headerlink" href="#cloud-storage-access" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>If you need to access a dataset in a more flexible way than the Compute button provides, then you can use the Cloud Storage Access box on the dataset page to copy the datasetâs container name. This unique identifer can then be used to allow direct access to the dataset.</p>

<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">It is not recommended that you deaccession a dataset or a version of a dataset. This is a very serious action that should only occur if there is a legal or valid reason for the dataset to no longer be accessible to the public. If you absolutely must deaccession, you can deaccession a version of a dataset or an entire dataset.</p>
</div>
<p>To deaccession, go to your published dataset (or add a new one and publish it), click the âEditâ button, and from the dropdown menu select âDeaccession Datasetâ. If you have multiple versions of a dataset, you can select here which versions you want to deaccession or choose to deaccession the entire dataset.</p>
<p>You must also include a reason as to why this dataset was deaccessioned. Select the most appropriate reason from the dropdown list of options. If you select âOtherâ, you must also provide additional information.</p>
<p>Add more information as to why this was deaccessioned in the free-text box. If the dataset has moved to a different repository or site you are encouraged to include a URL (preferably persistent) for users to continue to be able to access this dataset in the future.</p>
<p>If you deaccession the most recently published version of the dataset but not all versions of the dataset, you may then revisit an earlier version and create a new non-deaccessioned draft for the dataset. For example, imagine you have a version 1 and version 2 of a dataset, both published, and you deaccession version 2. You may then edit version 1 of the dataset and a new draft version will be created.</p>
<p><strong>Important Note</strong>: A tombstone landing page with the basic citation metadata will always be accessible to the public if they use the persistent URL (Handle or DOI) provided in the citation for that dataset.  Users will not be able to see any of the files or additional metadata that were previously available prior to deaccession.</p>
